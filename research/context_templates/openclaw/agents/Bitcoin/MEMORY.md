# MEMORY.md - Bitcoin Knowledge Base

*Curated Bitcoin knowledge, technical explanations, and insights. This is your long-term memory as a Bitcoin expert.*

## Created
- **Date:** February 2, 2026
- **Agent:** Satoshi Agent (₿)
- **Purpose:** Dedicated Bitcoin expertise repository

## Core Bitcoin Concepts (For Quick Reference)

### Protocol Fundamentals
- **Bitcoin:** A peer-to-peer electronic cash system (Satoshi Nakamoto, 2008)
- **Blockchain:** Distributed timestamp server, chain of blocks containing transactions
- **Proof-of-Work:** Mining consensus mechanism, SHA-256 hashing
- **UTXO Model:** Unspent Transaction Output model (not account-based)
- **Difficulty Adjustment:** Every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) to maintain 10-minute block time

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Hash Rate:** Total computational power securing the network
- **Mempool Size:** Number of unconfirmed transactions waiting
- **Fee Rates:** sat/vB (satoshis per virtual byte)
- **Network Difficulty:** Current mining difficulty
- **Block Height:** Current block number in the chain

## Common Explanations (Reusable)

### For Beginners
"Bitcoin is digital money that isn't controlled by any government or company. It's like digital gold that you can send over the internet."

### Technical Explanation
"Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger (blockchain) secured by proof-of-work mining. Transactions are grouped into blocks, miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to add blocks, and the longest valid chain is accepted as truth."

### Store of Value Narrative
"Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it digitally scarce. This scarcity, combined with its decentralization and security, gives it properties similar to gold."

## Important Historical Events

### Halvings
- 2012: 50 BTC → 25 BTC per block
- 2016: 25 BTC → 12.5 BTC per block  
- 2020: 12.5 BTC → 6.25 BTC per block
- 2024: 6.25 BTC → 3.125 BTC per block
- Next: ~2028 (3.125 BTC → 1.5625 BTC)

### Major Forks
- **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** 2017, block size increase
- **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** 2018, larger blocks, Craig Wright
- **Taproot:** 2021, privacy and smart contract upgrade (soft fork)

## Security Best Practices (Always Emphasize)

### Private Keys
- "Not your keys, not your coins"
- Hardware wallets for significant amounts
- Seed phrase backup (metal, multiple locations)
- Never digital storage of seed phrases

### Transaction Safety
- Always verify receiving addresses
- Test with small amounts first
- Use replace-by-fee (RBF) for important transactions
- Understand confirmation times vs. fee trade-offs

## Common Misconceptions to Correct

### "Bitcoin is anonymous"
- Correction: Bitcoin is pseudonymous. All transactions are public on the blockchain. Privacy requires additional techniques (CoinJoin, Taproot).

### "Bitcoin is too slow for payments"
- Correction: Base layer is for settlement (like gold bars). Lightning Network enables instant, cheap payments (like cash).

### "Bitcoin wastes energy"
- Correction: Bitcoin's energy use secures a global, censorship-resistant monetary network. Much comes from renewable/flared gas. Compare to traditional banking energy use.

## Useful Analogies (Use Carefully)

### Gold Analogy
- Mining: Like gold mining (energy intensive, creates new supply)
- Limited supply: Like gold's scarcity
- Store of value: Like gold's historical role

### Digital Cash Analogy
- Wallets: Like bank accounts
- Transactions: Like writing checks
- Blockchain: Like a public ledger everyone can verify
